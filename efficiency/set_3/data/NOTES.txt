## Calibration 
By: SA

The liquid radio metabolite with the activity of 460 microCi in 750ml of dilutor

the samples used for counting were:
1) 500nCi : 850ul of sample
2) 400nCi : 650ul of sample
3) 300mCi : 490ul of sample

the samples were counted each for 5 minutes in the rack 036 (Track 45min)



Due to DTF being close to 1.1, 2 additional samples were added:
4) 390 ul
5) 300 ul


the count was done two extra times on the day after on March 27th

## Notes on analyzing the data
By YS

- for this set I manually copy-pasted the data into a new excel spreadsheet but could use macros
- the sample masses used for analysis were those weighed by the hidex
- used unnormalized CPMs for all analysis
- the scripts only work if you use the same columns that are in efficiency_set3.csv. If changed, you need to change the script where the data is loaded.
- The csv file NEEDS to be saved with UTF-8 enabled
- Before saving to csv, all numbers need to be converted in excel to a general number format to remove the comma in the numbers.
